Title: Comparison of Protein Uptake Through the Analysis of Amino-Acid Levels in Blood after a Meal
Description: Functions to fit Wood curves through amino-acid time courses, measured in blood after a protein meal. From these Wood curves parameters of interest like AUC can be derived, and used in a mixed model to compare amino-acid uptake from different protein sources.
