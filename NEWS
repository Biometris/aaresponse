Changes in version 1.0.2: (now develop branch)

Changes in version 1.0.1:
  - extractParameters now returns an object of class 'aar' rather than
    just a data.frame
  - subsetting using the "what" argument in function fitWoodAll now
    leads to appropriate attributes for aanames and totalnames
  - added a warning in curateParameters: when single-AA data and AA
    totals are curated simultaneously, things may go wrong
  - changed axis labels of several plots to include default units
  - fixed bug in showDataFits, which created an error in the example
  - completed reference (Wood 1967; Wehrens et al. 2024)
